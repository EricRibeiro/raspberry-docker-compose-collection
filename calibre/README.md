### .env.example

The `.env.example` file is a template containing placeholder values that you need to fill in. After replacing the placeholders with your actual values, rename the file to `.env`. This file is essential for configuring the environment variables required by the container.

This variable sets the HTTP Basic authentication password for the Calibre container. The default value is `abc`. If this variable is not set, there will be no authentication required to access the Calibre web interface.

#### CALIBRE_USER

This variable sets the HTTP Basic authentication username for the Calibre container. The default value is `abc`.

#### DOCKER_VOLUME

This variable represents the path to the Docker volume that stores the configuration files and dependencies for the project. Replace the placeholder value with the appropriate path on your system.

#### DOCKER_SOURCE_BOOKS_VOLUME

This variable determines where the host machine's books are stored. Replace the placeholder value with the path to your e-book collection on your host system. This path will be mapped to `/books` in the container so that books can be added to Calibre easily.

#### DOCKER_CALIBRE_LIBRARY_VOLUME

This variable represents the path to the Docker volume that stores the Calibre library. This is where your books will be stored and managed by Calibre. Replace the placeholder value with the appropriate path on your system.
