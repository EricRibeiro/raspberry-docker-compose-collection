## Setup

This section provides a brief introduction to the setup process.

### .env.example

The `.env.example` file is a template containing placeholder values that you need to fill in. After replacing the placeholders with your actual values, rename the file to `.env`. This file is essential for configuring the environment variables required by the container.

#### DOCKER_VOLUME

This variable represents the path to the Docker volume that stores the configuration files and dependencies for the project. Replace the placeholder value with the appropriate path on your system.
